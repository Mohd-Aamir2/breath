# **App Name**: BreatheEasy

## Core Features:

- Hyperlocal AQI: Display real-time AQI data based on the user's current location, aggregated from various sources (CPCB monitors).
- Personalized Health Alerts: Provide personalized health alerts based on AQI levels and user-defined sensitivity levels (e.g., for asthma).
- Safe Route Suggestions: Suggest less polluted routes for commuting based on real-time AQI and traffic data.
- Short-Term AQI Forecasting: Provide short-term (24-72 hours) AQI forecasts using pre-trained AI/ML models to predict air quality trends.
- AQI Trend Visualization: Display historical and forecasted AQI data in interactive charts and graphs.
- Policy Impact Tool: Use historical AQI data, in combination with records of local interventions (like construction halts), as a tool the LLM uses to give hypothetical views of the effect of interventions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#78A7FF) to evoke a sense of cleanliness and openness, drawing inspiration from clear skies.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7) to provide a neutral, calming backdrop that doesn't distract from the data visualizations.
- Accent color: Soft green (#90EE90) to highlight improvements in air quality, suggesting nature and health. The analogous green creates a harmonious yet contrasting highlight against the primary blue.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif for readability and a modern, clean feel.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different pollution sources and health alerts.
- Prioritize data visualization and ease of access on both web and mobile platforms.
